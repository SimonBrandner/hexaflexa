hexaflexa
=========

Hexaflexa is a python program which makes hexaflexagon printouts, such that each face of the hexaflexagon shows a different picture. 

If you don't know what a hexaflexagon is, I recommend this great [series of youtube videos by Victoria Hart](//youtu.be/VIVIegSt81k) or this [website by Alejandro Kapauan](http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/hexahexa/hexahexa.html) or this [book by Martin Gardner](http://www.cambridge.org/nl/academic/subjects/mathematics/recreational-mathematics/hexaflexagons-probability-paradoxes-and-tower-hanoi-martin-gardners-first-book-mathematical-puzzles-and-games?format=PB&isbn=9780521735254). 

How to use the program
======================

To run hexaflexa you need [*pycairo*](https://cairographics.org/pycairo/).

Run 

    python hexaflexa.py --output 012345.pdf 0.png 1.png 2.png 3.png 4.png 5.png

You have to put in *six* different pictures or some faces will be empty. You can put in up to *nine* different pictures. The last three pictures should be watermark-images with given transparency values. 

-   The first three pictures will be printed on the *common* faces of the hexaflexagon, 
-   the next three pictures will be printed on the *hidden* faces, 
-   the (optional) last three pictures will be printed *over* the first three faces, but *twisted* and with a watermark/transparency effect. These *twisted* faces always appear (in their right orientation) after a hidden face, whereas the common faces will be twisted. 

This is a Sunday project. The main feature is that it works - more or less. 

So:
-   It only works with *png* image files. Convert all images to png. (Use for instance the program [*convert*](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php))
-   You have to make sure that the images are more or less square shaped. If they are wider or higher the program crops out a square. 
-   Depending on the size of your images the pdf file can become very big. It can take long to open / print it. If you print on A4/letter paper 600x600 pixels for each picture should give a decent quality for the printout. 
-   Some pdf viewers/printers have problems with transparency in the pdf files generated by cairo. Try different viewers. The adobe viewer worked for me. 

Protip:
-   Use the alpha channel/transparency feature of png-images to generate cool effects.

How to actually make the hexaflexagon 
=====================================

To actually fold the hexaflexagon use for instance these [instructions](http://britton.disted.camosun.bc.ca/hexahexa/hexahexa.html) for the *hexahexaflexagon*. 

If you read German, you can also use these very [detailed instructions](http://de.wikihow.com/Ein-Hexaflexagon-falten). 

At first you need to cut out the four different *double strips* of the print out. Next you fold the double strip in the middle and glue it together to get a single strip that can be used to fold a hexahexaflexagon with one of the instruction sets above. Every printout results in four hexaflexagon double strips to save paper and trees. 

If you find a bug or a problem with the instructions, you can write me a mail: michael.borinsky@posteo.de
